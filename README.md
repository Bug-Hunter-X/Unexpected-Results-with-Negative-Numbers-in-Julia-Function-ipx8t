# Julia Bug: Unexpected Results with Negative Numbers

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Julia function that involves handling negative numbers. The function `myfunction` aims to return the square of a number, ensuring a positive result regardless of the input's sign. However, due to Julia's operator precedence, unexpected results may be produced when dealing with negative numbers.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.jl` presents a corrected version.

## Bug Description
The core problem lies in the calculation `-x^2`. Julia will first calculate `x^2` and then negate the result. This differs from the intended behavior of squaring the absolute value of `x`, which would consistently yield a positive result.

## Solution
The bug is fixed by explicitly calculating the absolute value of `x` before squaring it, ensuring the correct positive result even for negative inputs.

## How to Reproduce
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `bug.jl` and `bugSolution.jl` in a Julia environment.
3.  Run the functions with both positive and negative input values.
4.  Observe the discrepancies in output between the original and the corrected versions.
